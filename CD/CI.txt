CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment/Delivery) is a methodology to automate and streamline the software development lifecycle, from writing code to deploying it in production.

1. **Continuous Integration (CI):**
   - Frequent integration of code into a shared repository.
   - Automated testing ensures changes donâ€™t break the system.
   - Benefits:
     - Detect bugs early.
     - Maintain a functional codebase.
   - Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.

2. **Continuous Delivery (CD):**
   - Ensures code passing CI is ready for deployment.
   - May include manual approvals for production.
   - Benefits:
     - Reduces deployment risks.
     - Enables frequent releases.

3. **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
   - Fully automates deployment to production after CI/CD pipelines pass.
   - Benefits:
     - Faster feature releases.
     - Immediate user feedback.

| Automation                | Testing and integration     | Release pipelines          | Full deployment             |
| Manual Intervention       | No                          | Optional                   | No                          |

CI/CD simplifies and accelerates software development by automating repetitive tasks, ensuring reliability, and allowing teams to focus on delivering value to users.
